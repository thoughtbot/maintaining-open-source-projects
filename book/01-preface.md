# Preface

If you want to learn the soft skills needed to grow and maintain an open source
project, this book is for you. Leading open source projects comes with
non-technical responsibilities. A project maintainer should feel comfortable
shaping the community, managing the repository, keeping good communication with
different people, deciding when to release new versions and prioritizing all
these kinds of tasks.

Software companies can benefit from the practices that open source teams have
been doing well for years as well: thorough code reviews, forthright
communication, and efficient collaboration, for example. The best open source
teams also have clear documentation, regular releases and predictable
versioning. This book explores all of the above.

Other kinds of collaborative projects, such as
[libraries](https://github.com/GITenberg),
[government data](https://github.com/project-open-data),
[geographical data](https://openmundi.github.io/),
[media](http://search.creativecommons.org/),
to name a few, will find the workflows described here useful as well.

Whether you lead open source initiatives, agile or other forms of collaborative
projects, this book will help you make your work more effective. In the pages
that follow, you will find a compilation of some of the best practices for
creating, maintaining and growing these types of work.
