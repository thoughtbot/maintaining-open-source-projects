# Preface

If you want to learn the soft skills needed to grow and maintain an open source
project, this book is for you. Maintaining open source projects comes with many
responsibilities that are nontechnical. A project leader should feel comfortable
shaping the community, promoting the library, maintaining good communication
with many people, deciding when to release new versions, etc.

If you want to learn how open source contributors are organized and the ways
they develop software to apply those practices in your team, this book is for
you too. Many software companies successfully apply open source practices in
their day-to-day work, creating very efficient collaboration in a team and
across teams to make a project succeed.

If you lead other kinds of collaborative projects, such us
[libraries](https://github.com/GITenberg), [government
data](https://github.com/project-open-data), [geographical
data](https://openmundi.github.io/), [media](http://search.creativecommons.org/)
or others, many of the guidelines described in this book will be applicable as
well.

This is what we have learned about creating, maintaining and growing our open
source projects.
