# Maintaining Quality

As a maintainer, you spend a significant amount of your open source time doing
code review. There are two primary types of feedback you can provide:

* High level: about software design, design patterns, anti-patterns,
    architecture, suggestion of alternative implementations.
* Low level: details like matching coding style with the surroundings of the
    file or project, indentation, and naming conventions.

A high-level plan is key to the success of the project. Weak foundations can
complicate updating or extending the software, which in turn over time can stall
development altogether.

It might seem that style feedback on style is less relevant, as an unnecessary
comma or a misspelled name won’t break any feature. But small discrepancies give
the impression of individual developers working without purpose rather than a
team working together toward a common goal. Lack of attention to detail conveys
an attitude that might permeate other aspects of a project like readability,
dependency management and testing. An inconsistent style is a superficial but
notable sign that people don’t care much about quality.

Kees Keizer and colleagues from the University of Groningen [conducted
experiments] showing that if people observe a certain social norm or legitimate
rule was violated, they are more likely to violate other norms or rules, causing
disorder to spread. This effect is also known as “broken windows” - one broken
window in a building is enough to increase the chances that more will appear.

Bram Moolenaar, author and maintainer of the popular text editor called Vim,
suggests maintainers to set a precedent:

> Write nice code. Use white space properly, use good names for methods, add
> comments to explain anything that isn’t obvious, etc. If you write ugly code,
> anyone who intends to fix a bug or add a feature will not enjoy his [or her]
> work and likely avoid it next time.

One reason it’s good to take care of code quality at every level is that good
software quality keeps maintenance costs low. Poor structural quality in
business applications results in cost and schedule overruns. It also creates
waste in the form of rework. Jussi Koskinen, an Engineering Researcher, cites
studies in [_Software Maintenance Costs_] that show the relative cost of
maintaining software and managing its evolution represents more than 50% of
its total cost!

Let’s see how we can control these costs.

## Adopt a style guide

Programming style is a set of rules used while writing code. A style guide
establishes and enforces style to improve communication, helping programmers
read and understand source code. It ensures consistency within a file and across
multiple files. It also enforces best practices. When a group of people adhere
to the same guidelines, all the files feel familiar to everyone.

You can write the coding standard for your project or adopt an existing one.
Any guidelines are useful, as any one of them will handle a myriad of little
decisions for you and your team so you don’t need to think about them in the
future. It doesn’t matter what decisions these are; the point is avoiding having
to discuss them frequently. Code should conform with the guidelines to ensure
that there’s little room for opinions and "bike-shed" type discussions.
Guidelines save time for you to focus on the deeper concepts of a given
changeset and the high-level overview of the code under review.

Here is a list of three sample style guides and coding standards:

* [Most popular Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
* [Symfony’s PHP coding standard](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
* [thoughtbot style guides for different languages and
    frameworks](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style#style)

Public discussions in pull requests shape these standards, deciding not only
on superficial style but also fostering best practices
whenever possible. For example, in Ruby it’s better to avoid rescuing the
general `Exception` class, as it traps OS signals to exit a process, requiring
one to do a non-catchable `KILL` to end execution of the script. thoughtbot
guidelines advise against that practice. People who follow popular guidelines
might avoid rough edges even when they are not conscious of them.

If you are working on side projects, however, you may throw away conventions and
ignore everything anyone has ever said. Because, as [Harrison Shoff delightfully
answers in a critique of his guidelines], lack of process is what gets us to new
discoveries. Not everything has to feel cookie cut, particularly for
explorations.

Style guides can help polish reliability, performance, security, maintainability
and size of your software. You can research the reasoning behind each rule and
analyze if they apply to you and your team. Even without the need of learning
all the contexts you can still achieve healthy results! Follow the rules that
hundreds of people from your community have discussed or shaped, and break them
when they don’t make sense any longer for you.


## Use static analysis tools

The existence of a document that specifies a process is not enough for people to
follow it. You might be surprised, take a moment to sink that in. You will
continue receiving contributions in the most creative styles you have ever
seen, and you might not be happiest about the originality contributors show.

If you receive a contribution with guidelines violations that you’d rather see
followed, you are left with these options:

1. Ignore the changes. Don’t merge, which is rude to the contributor(s). It also
   doesn’t help the project if the code changes are functionally useful.

2. Ignore the guidelines. Merge, which leads to sloppy looking code.

3. Merge and apply style changes yourself. This is time-consuming and will
   clutter the git history with stylistic rather than functional changes.

4. Comment on every violation, working with the author until the changeset is
   good. This is time-consuming and can get socially awkward.

5. Do nothing, and let a robot comment on every style violation in virtually no
   time, consistently, with no emotions.

Ruby has a tool called rubocop that exposes style violations. Hound CI is a
product that uses rubocop, and it comments in the changed lines of patches
that do not conform to the style guides. Hound is consistently the
first reviewer of any patch in the projects that set it up. It being
a robot, it avoids the potentially awkward situation of nitpicking style
violations over a contribution. People rarely get offended by a robot dog. It is
indeed waiting to criticize your style, but it does so always, with the same
speed, consistency and lack of passion each time. People can handle Hound items
ahead of your review, leaving code that reads as if anyone on your team wrote
it.

Other useful static analysis tools are:

* For JavaScript code, Douglas Crockbford’s tricky to please [JSLint], or the
    configurable fork [JSHint].
* [RIPS] for PHP security analysis.
* [Brakeman] for Rails security analysis.
* [Flog] for Ruby code complexity.
* [Flay] for Ruby code duplication.
* [Wikipedia list of static analysis tools].

Let machines do what they are good at, and humans do what machines can’t do: you
can stop thinking about _how_ code is changing to focus better on _what_ is
changing.


## Request regression tests for every change

Testing helps verify whether, after introducing new behavior or updating the
project, the change has had the intended effect. Tests help us gain confidence
that the project:

* Meets its requirements
* Responds correctly to all kinds of input
* Performs its functions within an acceptable time frame
* Is usable
* Can be installed and run in its intended environments

Testing cannot establish that a product functions well under any condition, but
can determine that it does not function properly under specific conditions. A
failing test is the most specific description of an issue a project can get. In
an ideal world, we would have a failing test accompanying the natural language
description of every issue.

These tests will in turn serve as regression tests. A regression happens if a
change has unintended consequences over other parts of the project. Having tests
covering each bug fix protect us in an automated way from reappearing bugs,
making the software more predictable.


## Run tests on every commit

Running tests before committing to master helps avoid one developer’s work
breaking another copy of the software. Continuous Integration originally described a
workflow in which every developer would run all unit tests in their local
environment and verify they passed before sharing changes.

Nowadays build servers automatically run all tests after every commit, and
report results to the authors closing a tight feedback loop. In addition to automated
tests, CI environments can implement continuous processes for general quality
control. Such processes run additional static and dynamic tests, measure and
profile performance, extract and format documentation from the source code, and
facilitate manual QA processes. This continuous application of quality control
aims to improve visibility over the project’s quality.

[Travis CI] is an open-source continuous integration service for projects hosted
on GitHub. It’s free for open source projects. As other similar services, it
automatically detects new commits in any branch, tries to build the project and
run its tests. It notifies the developer about the success or failure of the run
upon completion.

[Travis CI]: https://travis-ci.com/

Travis CI will test all combinations you specify of runtimes to test against,
dependency versions, and environment variables.

An example configuration file for a ruby library might be:

```
language: ruby

rvm:
  - 2.0
  - 2.1
  - 2.2

env:
  - DATABASE=mongodb
  - DATABASE=postgresql
  - DATABASE=redis

gemfile:
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.rails32
  - Gemfile.rails41
  - Gemfile.rails42
```

This results in a 3×3×4 build matrix that will validate your project runs in the
many combinations of rails and ruby version, and database your users may have.

By automating as many quality controls as possible in a CI environment, you will
make sure there is visibility into the project’s different quality measurements,
helping your team and community take care of them.


## Choose your own priorities

When you start a new project you follow a set of values and priorities, whether
you are conscious about it or not. You produce work with a belief, taste or
deliberate decision on what is most important for your project and community,
and take decisions based on that.

An (incomplete) list of values one might prioritize are:

* Reliability
* Security
* Usability
* Design
* Code quality
* Popularity
* Performance
* Cleverness

A prioritization of values you might like in your community can be:

* Collaboration
* Friendliness
* Experience
* Low barrier of entry
* Stability
* Numbers (lines of code, commits, etc)

<!--
As a maintainer, each decision you take and each interaction you have with the
community sets a tone. You might show happiness about certain things, anger or
indifference about others. Each issue you close, each patch you merge,
each thread you participate in shows your values, and that will probably grow a
following of people who share them. See examples of how maintainers set the
priorities of their projects in these threads:

* TODO: A Rails thread speaking about conventions
* TODO: A reactive.js thread speaking about performance
* TODO: A GNU thread speaking about licenses
* TODO: A FreeBSD thread enforcing code quailty, correctness, simplicity or “elegance”
* TODO: An OpenBSD thread on security of different implementations
-->

A developer will like it if the object model is close to the real world domain
model and code is loosely coupled. A customer may think a product is good if it
can be understood and used in less than a minute. A product owner will find the
software healthy if it’s profitable. Different people see the same product
through different lenses. What’s irrelevant to one project is essential to
another.

As the project’s maintainer, you’re in a unique position to define the values of
your project’s community. In this chapter we’ve mainly discussed values related
to code quality: adhering to a style guide, maintaining test coverage, using CI,
and so on. A project that doesn’t honor these values is less likely to succeed,
but a project certainly won’t succeed if no one wants to work on it. Make sure
that the values you choose to cultivate resonate with potential contributors and
help make the project something you can be proud of.
