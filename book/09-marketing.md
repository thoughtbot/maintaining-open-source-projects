# Marketing

Marketing an open source project is just as important as efficiently
maintaining its code base. Otherwise, much time and effort will be spent laying
the foundation for a community that may never thrive. Until you are satisfied
with the size of your project, a portion of your time should always be dedicated
to marketing it.

Also, before we delve any deeper into this topic, an aside - in present day, the
work "marketing" has developed some negative connotations. This is due to the
fact that one marketing technique, advertising, has been abused by many, so
much to the extent that many find the term synomymous with the word marketing.
In fact, it is quite the opposite, think of it as only one tool in a box of
marketing techniques.

Before we can focus on any marketing tool (or method) for an open source
project, however, we must first learn about the two fundamental raw materials of
at the heart of a successful marketing endeavor - **usability** and
**visibility**.

## Usability

Any successful marketing effort must have something usable at the receiving end
of what the marketer seeks to attract people toward. This may sound like a
no-brainer, but consider the other chapters in this book. One may no doubt have
already learned at this point, many things that can significantly increase the
usability factor of an open source project, so that other people can easily
get involved, and efficiently contribute as time passes by.

At the heart of an open source project's usability factor is it's unique value
proposition. The unique value proposition (UVP) of a project should be one
sentence that quickly sums up the problem a project solves for it's users. For
example, Facebook's UVP is that it helps people connect with friends and
family. Uber's UVP is that it's everyone's private driver. Your open source
project should have a similar, succinct, UVP. Whether it's a new distribution of
Linux or a very specific library or technical niche, it should be summed up in a
sentence so users can quickly identify whether or not it's something they should
continue to read into.

From there, hundreds and thousands of people may discover a project over time,
but usability challenges continue. If it isn't extremely usable and friendly in
a multitude of ways, marketing efforts will only be as good as the project's
ability to help people fulfill the goal of the visitor - like a fast food
restaurant without a drive-thru. It should very efficiently and succinctly solve
their problem. Examples of areas where special attention should be paid to
improving usability are:
- Repository landing page
- Project's web site (if one exists)
- Code quality
- Efficient management of issues and pull requests
- Clear and concise messaging throughout about what the user should do
- Good documentation
- Localization/transaltions (at a certain level of scale)

The above items are just a start (again, consider the different variables that
come into play when maintaining an open source project that have been outlined
in this book). That said, it should be clear how usability is an important
component to marketing efforts.

## Visibility

Now that usability has been considered, it's time to look away from the borders
of the open source project - it's codebase, it's repository and/or website. It's
time to look to the great beyond
