# Maintaining Open Source Projects

### Pitch

There are many aspects to fostering an open source project. Building a
community, promoting a repository and maintaining good communication, are just a
few factors. This book is our take on how to create, grow and maintain a
successful open source project.


### Thesis

A successful open source project is original, solves a problem well and has
pristine code quality. As one can surely already guess, however, this is much
easier said than done and requires a large amount of work - something we'll
thoroughly dissect in this book.


### Who is the target audience of this book?

Any person or company that is a maintainer of an open source project, or is
considering becoming one, should read this book.

For anyone with public repositories on GitHub, this book is useful.

Managers or company owners who apply open source practices in their day-to-day
work will also find this book helpful.

### What problems can this book help you solve?

Your project may have a following and you don't know how to communicate with it,
prioritize their requests or efficiently manage/answer questions.

You want to learn the communication patterns that make it possible for a large
and popular Open Source project to move forward, when your 5-people team can't
come to agreement on things like how to name a variable.

You want to make sure your bar is high enough for providing a reliable project
to your following.

You want to follow best practices but can't know them all. For example, when to
release new versions, how to decide version numbers, when to open source, when
to add contributors and what to automate.

You want to get your project more attention and grow its user base.


### Building a release

Run `make release`. It will update the release branch with latest build from
master.
