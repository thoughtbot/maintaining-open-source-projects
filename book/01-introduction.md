The history of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects is fascinating. We
will not talk about it in this book, if you are interested you should see the
[Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software)
for it, which contains a good introduction and tons of linked resources.

As software developers we are used to thinking about software projects, but
there are also different kinds of collaborative projects, such as
[libraries](https://github.com/GITenberg), [government
data](https://github.com/project-open-data), [geographical
data](https://openmundi.github.io/),
[media](http://search.creativecommons.org/), etc., for which many of the
guidelines described here are also applicable.

This is what we have learned about creating, maintaining and growing our open
source projects.
