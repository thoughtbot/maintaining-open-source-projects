# Preface

If you want to learn the soft skills needed to grow and maintain an open source
project, this book is for you. Leading open source projects comes with
non-technical responsibilities. A project maintainer should feel comfortable
shaping the community, promoting the library, keeping good communication with
different people, deciding when to release new versions, and prioritizing
between all these tasks.

Software companies can benefit from the practices that open source teams have
been doing well for years: thorough code reviews, forthright communication,
and efficient collaboration. The best open source teams also have clear
documentation, regular releases, and predictable versioning. This book explores
all of the above.

Other kinds of collaborative projects, such as
[libraries](https://github.com/GITenberg),
[government data](https://github.com/project-open-data),
[geographical data](https://openmundi.github.io/),
[media](http://search.creativecommons.org/),
and others, will find the workflows described here useful as well.

Whether you lead open source, agile or other forms of collaborative projects, in
this book you will find guidelines to make your work more effective. This is
what we learned about creating, maintaining and growing our open source
projects.
