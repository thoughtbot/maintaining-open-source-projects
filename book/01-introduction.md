# Preface

Maintaining open source projects comes with many responsibilities that are non
technical. A project leader should feel comfortable shaping the community,
promoting the library, maintaining good communication with many people, deciding
when to release new versions, etc. If you want to learn the soft skills needed
to grow and maintain an open source project, this book is for you.

Many software companies successfully apply open source practices in their
day-to-day work, creating very efficient collaboration in a team and across
teams to make a project succeed. If you want to learn how open source
contributors are organized and the ways they develop software to apply those
practices in your team, this book is for you.

As Software Developers we are used to thinking about software projects, but
there are also different kinds of collaborative projects such as
[libraries](https://github.com/GITenberg), [government
data](https://github.com/project-open-data), [geographical
data](https://openmundi.github.io/),
[media](http://search.creativecommons.org/), etc., for which many of the
guidelines described here are applicable too.

The history of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects is fascinating, and
can teach you the reasons why the community was shaped the way it is today. We
will not talk about this here as it’s not directly relevant to how to lead
projects, but if you are interested I encourage you to read the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software)
for it, which contains a good introduction and several linked resources. A
book you might enjoy that speaks about the transition from centralized to
decentralized software development teams in the 1990’s is “The Cathedral and the
Bazaar”, from open source author and advocate Eric Raymond.

This is what we have learned about creating, maintaining and growing our open
source projects.
