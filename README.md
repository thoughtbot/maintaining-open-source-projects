# Maintaining Open Source Projects

### Pitch

There are many aspects to fostering an open source project: building community,
promoting the library, maintaining good communication, among other factors. This
book is our take on how to create, grow and maintain a successful open source
project.


### Thesis

A successful open source project is not only one that is original, solves a
particular problem well, or has pristine code quality. Those are but the tip of
the iceberg, which we'll thoroughly dissect with this book.


### Who is the target audience of this book?

Any person or company that is a maintainer of an open source project, or is
considering becoming one, should read this book.

If you have a public repository, and someone you don't know is using it, you will
find this book useful.

Managers or company owners who apply or want to apply open source practices in
their day-to-day work will also find this book helpful.

### Why do they want to buy and read it?

Your project may have a following and you don't know how to communicate with it,
prioritize their requests, how and when to answer questions.

You want to learn the communication patterns that make it possible for large
and popular Open Source projects to move forward, while your 5-person team can't
come to agree on things like how to name a variable.

You want to make sure your bar is high enough for providing a reliable project
to your following.

You want to follow best practices but can't know them all. For example, when to release new
versions, how to decide version numbers, when to open source, when to add
contributors, and what to automate.

You want to get your project more attention and grow its user base.


### Building a release

Building requires `paperback` gem, which is not free software yet.

Run `make release`. It will update the release branch with latest build from
master.
